# Salon appointment scheduler: PostgreSQL and Bash scripting project
#### FreeCodeCamp's relational database certification project (www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler-project/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler).
This is my solution for FCC's relational database project. The task was to create a Bash script wherewith a user can book appointments for different services. The appointments, users and the available services are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
